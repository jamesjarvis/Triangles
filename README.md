This is a project made for the Triangles assignment given around the 23rd January 2018.

I decided to make a visualisation of how the algorithms would solve the problem.

Basically testing my Java.awt graphics knowledge as well as git and various algorithms.


In order to use the program, run the main method and click on the window to generate a path for each problem.
Each click moves on to the next problem, until all problems run out.
